Group Creativity:
We wanted to give our game a theme. With the game being called "Hexed" with Halloween coming up, we decided to do a witch/spooky theme. The goal of the game (guessing the right hex value) is framed as trying to undo the hex the player has been put under. 

Charlotte's Contributions:
I completed the majority of the Javascript functions, including the guess button, basic slider functionality, percentOff, scoring.
Instructions javascript for hide and show on click.
Added tombstone, formatting and layout for name, score, and turns.
Added invalid hex value alert.

Rachel's Contributions:
I built out the HTML/CSS for the opening screen, wrote some of the JavaScript for the jQuery slider functionality, designed the graphics used in the game and wrote any HTML/CSS/JavaScript associated with the graphics, and helped create the UX design of the game.

For the graphics, I used illustrations and watercolor textures by NassyArt (https://www.pixelsurplus.com/graphics/luxury-witchcraft-magic-graphics), which are free for both personal and commerical use. The font used in the logo is Alexandria by VPCreativeShop (https://www.pixelsurplus.com/freebies/alexandria-free-font), and this typeface is also free for both personal and commercial use. I then edited the logo and button background images using Adobe Photoshop.

Overall visual design: The main colors of our application are purple, black, and white. Since our game has a witchy/Halloween theme, we decided on purple as our main accent color. Since the purpose of the game is to guess the randomly generated color (shown as a "hex" spell in the cauldron), I didn't want the other colors of the game to be distracting, which led me to choose black and white for the other visual elements. 
To match the "witch" theme, I chose graphics and fonts that had a more elegant aesthetic versus using more modern flat design or cartoon style typefaces and images.

I referred to this website (https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/how-to-check-if-string-is-hexadecimal/162739/7) when writing the function to check if a hex value is invalid.

Arya's Contributions:
I created the timer, the jquery popup at the beginning, the json data from the settings to index page, and the random color
generation. In terms of creativity I was in charge of the functionaltiy of much of the creativity if that makes sense. 

I made a border for the popup at the beginning, fiddled with the background colors, etc. For the tombstone I adjusted some of
the text to make sure that it was centered properly. As I said before, most of my contribtution to this project was 
functionality in regards to jquery.
